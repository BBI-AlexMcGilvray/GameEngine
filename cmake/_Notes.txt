1. Run 'cmake .' in ./builds/
    - adding '-DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64' makes it 64 bit, but that fails
        - seems to be due to the SDL cmake settings identifying 32 bit builds instead of 64 (likely due to default generator?)
2. Run 'cmake --build .' in ./builds/

// Dependencies
- try to remove pre-build libraries and build sdl and glew when building project
- sdl uses cmake, should just be able to reference the library that gets built
- glew uses a makefile, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18346849/how-to-get-cmake-to-use-existing-makefile
