// should be able to return a point when an axis value subbed into ellipsoid2, an ellipsoid2 of possible values when an axis value is subbed into ellipsoid3,
// an ellipsoid3 of possible values when an axis value is subbed into an ellipsoid4, and so on for if 2 (or 3 or 4) axis values are subbed in
// NOTE: may want to have a way to nicely pass an axis/value pair. (Should be added to math defs - possible all axis' can just have values as well?
