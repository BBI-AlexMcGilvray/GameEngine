- look into the skeleton data generated from assimp - something seems off
	- maybe do this after working on skinning and animations as it may just be a broken 'default' pose?
	- assimp data seems like it is the RELATIVE transform according to docs, maybe just convert to world for export
		- we will likely be using world coords instead of local
