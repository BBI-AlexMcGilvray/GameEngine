- look into the skeleton data generated from assimp - something seems off
	- maybe do this after working on skinning and animations as it may just be a broken 'default' pose?
	- assimp data seems like it is the RELATIVE transform according to docs, maybe just convert to world for export
		- we will likely be using world coords instead of local

	- [C/C++ -> Output Files -> Object File Name] is set to $(IntDir)/%(RelativeDir)/ due to the above
	- I think this is needed because classes with templates will also compile the header, and maybe windows gets confused by [Name].h and [Name].cpp sharing the same name?
		- Maybe two [Name].obj files are generated? - this does seem to be the case, there are two .obj files being generated now, but they are separated by their relative paths
