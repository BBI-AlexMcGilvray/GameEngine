This is where we should handle importing of external assets.
The actual triggering of an import can be triggered externally, but it should be handled here.

ex:
// elsewhere
- drag image from PC into image ui
- release -> triggers image import
// here
- show the ui to name + select options for the import 
- import the actual asset

Generally this will go through the existing (but should be modified) asset importing from ASSIMP
We should be using the proper (new but untested) asset mapping stuff with some meta data

ex: Model
- trigger 
- [select name/type/location]
- Load model in ASSIMP
- import based on the above settings to custom handling

ex: Texture
- trigger
- [select name/type/location]
- does not/can't go through ASSIMP, so directly import based on above settings
