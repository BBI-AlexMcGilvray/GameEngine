- Export/save data
    - states
    - entities
    - components

- Use AssetLocationMapping to load up assets instead of AssetType
    - keep AssetType anyways?

- Ability to select an entity (i.e. click on things in the state)
    - start off by verifying by testing clicking on objects (with a specfiic compoennt) remove their velocity component (so they stop moving)
    - Archetypes should be able to apply a visitor to their component lists
        ** see below
    - ComponentLists should be able to apply a visitor to their components
        ** Do not put this in Archetype/ComponentLists, make it instead a helper function that takes an archetype and a visitor, then goes through the archetype's componentlists and applies the visitor
            * this is not related to an archetype, so it shouldn't live in it
        - this is how we can act on their data
        - ex: 
            - print out all the information when clicked on ***** START WITH THIS *****
            - create UI for their information
                - this would go a similar route to the json stuff where all the UIs are written separately, and each type is provided a UI
                - then when you are given a type, you can visit it/do whatever logic is needed to create the UI for it
- Ability to display all relevant entity data
    - should dynamically show everything for all components the entity has
    - best way to do this is likely to just make the components themselves using the POD macro (or REFLECTABLE)
        - any non-serialized values should be defined OUTSIDE of the macro

- Make the Factory no longer be a distinct project, should instead be a type of build that includes the Factory library
    - Existing Factory logic of external asset -> ASSIMP -> internal asset should be used instead when (through the Factory build type) and external asset is referenced
    - This becomes the proper 'editor' that should have UI and asset inclusion, saving, and the like
    - Though we may not be able to have the 'editor ui' be fully external in the library (circular references?)
        - So for now we may have the UI be in the Pipeline library and reference the ASSIMP -> internal asset logic be referenced by internal

- Fix 'Application' namespace to be 'Pipeline'

- Make the existing factories handle ALL existing types instead of just a subset

- Look into load times when referencing assets
    - Why is it so slow?
